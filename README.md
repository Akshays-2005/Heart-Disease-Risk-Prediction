## 📘 Short Project Summary

The Heart Disease Prediction System is a modern, responsive web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using 13 clinical parameters. Users enter medical values such as age, cholesterol, ECG results, and more. These inputs are analyzed by a Machine Learning model (Random Forest) which returns a clear risk prediction:

- Low Risk

- Medium Risk

- High Risk

This project is designed for students, healthcare enthusiasts, and researchers, combining clean UI/UX with real-world ML inference.

---

## 🧠 What the Project Does

- Provides an interactive, responsive form to enter 13 clinical features

- Auto-saves user input using localStorage

- Includes utility actions:

  - Load Demo Data

  - Reset Form

  - Clear Saved Inputs

- Sends data to a backend ML API for prediction

- Displays clear and professional risk results

- Offers a Demo Prediction Mode when backend is offline

---

## 🙌 Why This Project is Useful

- Demonstrates practical ML integration in healthcare

- Provides structured, guided patient data entry

- Helps understand clinical risk factors

- Serves as a strong portfolio project for ML + Web Dev

- Easy backend integration and extensibility

## ⚙️ How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akshays-2005/Heart-Disease-Prediction
cd Heart-Disease-Prediction
```

### 2️⃣ Run the Frontend

No build process; open directly:
```bash
cd Frontend
open index.html
```
Or double-click index.html.

### 3️⃣ Run the Backend (Node.js)
```bash
cd Backend
npm install
python save_model.py
npm start
```

Backend runs at:
```bash
http://localhost:3000
```
